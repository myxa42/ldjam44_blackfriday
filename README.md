If you want to compile it yourself, you will have to download all the asset packs (AFAIK Unity Asset Store EULA
prohibits redistribution of store assets outside of the store, even the free ones). Check out `DownloadMe.txt`
files in the corresponding subfolders in `Assets/AssetPacks`. All assets were free at the time when they were
downloaded.
